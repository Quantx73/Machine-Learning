1/- Logistic Regression - Titanic Data

For this lecture we will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This is a very famous data set and very often is a student's first step in machine learning! 

We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.
Let's begin our understanding of implementing Logistic Regression in Python for classification.

We'll use a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this lecture notebook.


2/-Logistic Regression Project - Advertisement(Company Website)Â¶

In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

This data set contains the following features:

'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
'Age': cutomer age in years
'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
'City': City of consumer
'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
'Country': Country of consumer
'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
